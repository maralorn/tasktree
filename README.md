# Tasktree

This tool shows your [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org) tasks in a tree by introducing a new `partof` uda.

## Features

* Showing arbitrary queries to taskwarrior (refresh by hitting enter)
* Showing task properties: `description, status, tags, project, due, wait, entry, modified`
* Sort your tasks in a tree structure with drag and drop
* Delete/Undelete by setting checkbox
* Complete/Uncomplete by setting checkbox
* Create new task by filling new child field
* Edit task descriptions

I do not promise that there will come any more features. But a lot comes to mind. Pull requests welcome.

## Install
### Build Requirements

* rust
* cargo

### Run Requirements

* taskwarrior >= 2.5
* gtk >=3.18

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/maralorn/tasktree
cd tasktree
cargo install
```

### Configure Taskwarrior

Add these two lines to your `.taskrc`.
```
uda.partof.type=string
uda.partof.label=Part of
```
(If you donâ€™t do this, you will get a lot of garbage in descriptions when you try to create a tree. Otherwise, you can use the tool without this. But then you have a task list, not a tree.)

### Run


Make sure `$HOME/.cargo/bin/` is in your path.

```
tasktree
```
(You can also just hit it with `cargo run` in the repo.)
